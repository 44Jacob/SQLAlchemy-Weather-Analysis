Climate Analysis Project

Quick Overview

In this project  we dive into climate data using Python tools (SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Matplotlib) to analyze weather trends. The first part 

is all about data analysis, and the second part will make these analyses available through a Flask API.

Done So Far:

Connected to a climate database.

Analyzed precipitation and weather station data.

Visualized the last year's precipitation and temperature data.

Next Steps:

I need to Build a Flask API to share the climate data analysis.

Help Along the Way:

I've got great guidance from my tutor on SQL and databases.

ChatGPT helped with SQL queries and clarifying concepts.

How to Run This:

Make sure you have Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Flask installed.

Check out the analysis in climate_starter.ipynb.

Launch the Flask app with python app.py to explore the data through API endpoints.

Looking Forward:

I am excited to wrap up with the Flask API to make the climate data insights accessible to everyone. Stay tuned!
