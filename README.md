Climate Analysis Project with Flask API: Insights Unveiled
Climate Analysis Project

Overview

This project dives deep into climate data analysis using Python, SQLAlchemy ORM, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The journey began with data 
exploration and analysis, followed by the development of a Flask API to share our insights widely.

Project Phases

Data Exploration and Analysis
Database Connection: Established with SQLAlchemy create_engine.
Table Reflection: Used SQLAlchemy automap_base for ORM classes.
Session Linkage: Created a SQLAlchemy session to query the database.
Analyses Performed: Included precipitation analysis and station analysis, with data visualization to interpret climate trends.

Flask API Development

Completion: The Flask API is now complete, making climate data insights accessible to everyone.
Features: The API offers routes for precipitation data, station lists, and temperature observations of the most-active station.
Experience

Building the Flask API was an enriching experience that not only allowed me to apply my data analysis skills but also taught me valuable lessons in web development and data sharing. The process was both challenging and rewarding, resulting in a tool that brings climate data analysis to the fingertips of interested users.

Stay Tuned!
The Flask API is a testament to the power of combining data analysis with web technologies. Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements as we continue to explore new ways to make climate data more accessible and engaging.
